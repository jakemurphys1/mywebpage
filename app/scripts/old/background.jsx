      <p>In May of 2010, I graduated from Clemson University with a degree in Industrial Engineering. For the next six years, I worked in the manufacturing setting with my degree. I quickly became the go-to guy for all new technologies. I was frequently tasked with learning, mastering, and teaching these technologies in a short period.</p>
      <p>While I also excelled in the Engineering tasks of my jobs, I found my successes from these technologies to be more satisfying. I enjoyed my classes in programming at my stay in Clemson, so I began learning Javascript in my spare time. I continued my self-education for about a year and, after my contract ended with my previous employer, I decided to make a change. I registered for The Iron Yard and began going deeper into front-end development.</p>
      <p>The greatest asset I can provide is my ability to master new things quickly and thoroughly seasoned through my years at Clemson University and my years in the Engineering field. Programming is constantly changing, and I am prepared for whatever new challenges await.</p>
